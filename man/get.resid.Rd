\title{Compute Residual Matrices Adjusting for Outcome and Covariates}
\usage{
get.resid(X, Y, A)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix of features (rows = samples, columns = features).}

\item{Y}{A numeric vector or matrix of outcome values.}

\item{A}{A numeric matrix of covariates to adjust for.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{X.tilde}{Residual matrix after removing the effect of Y from X.}
\item{X.star}{Residual matrix after removing the effect of A from X.}
}
}
\description{
Regresses each column of X on Y and A, then computes two residual matrices:
X.tilde (removing the effect of Y) and X.star (removing the effect of A).
}
\details{
For each feature j in X, a linear model \code{X[,j] ~ Y + A} is fit.
X.tilde is obtained by subtracting the Y component, and X.star is obtained
by subtracting the A component. These residual matrices are used in
the scaPCoA-R (residualization) variant.
